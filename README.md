# AI-Trading-Algorithm


## Project Overview

The **AI-Driven Trading Algorithm** is a powerful tool for making informed buy and sell decisions in the stock market. This algorithm employs cutting-edge techniques and technical indicators to provide actionable insights for traders and investors. It has been meticulously designed to fetch historical stock price data, preprocess the data, build a sophisticated trading model, execute trading strategies, and evaluate performance metrics.

## Key Features

- **Data Fetching:** This algorithm uses the Quandl library to fetch historical stock price data. Users can specify the stock symbol and the date range for analysis.

- **Data Preprocessing:** Fetched data is subjected to comprehensive preprocessing, including feature engineering and data cleaning. Technical indicators such as Moving Averages (MAs) are meticulously calculated to enhance the trading strategy.

- **Model Building:** The algorithm leverages a combination of moving averages, including short-term and long-term MAs. It generates buy and sell signals based on sophisticated confirmation conditions derived from these MAs.

- **Trading Strategy Execution:** Buy and sell signals are employed to determine trading positions. Position changes, daily returns, and actual daily returns are calculated to simulate the trading strategy over time.

- **Performance Evaluation:** The algorithm evaluates the performance of the trading strategy by computing essential metrics. These metrics include total return, annualized return, maximum drawdown, and Sharpe ratio, offering valuable insights into the strategy's profitability and risk.

## Usage Instructions

To use this AI-driven trading algorithm, follow these steps:
